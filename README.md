# My Waybar config
#### this is my waybar configuration for my hyprland setup.
###### it has battery, volume, updates, youtube subscribers count, day, time, and date, and a tray
###### I am having some minor issues with the tray randomly not populating on launch of waybar but other than that
it works fine
